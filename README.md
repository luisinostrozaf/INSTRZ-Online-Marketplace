# INSTRZ-Online-Marketplace

INSTRZ is an Online Marketplace that allows you, as an admin user, to create, delete, and edit items to publish in the marketplace.

Developed as one of my Fullstack Developer portfolio projects, it is built in Python using Django framework, Html and a little bit of JavaScript.

TO RUN IT

1) create virtual environment

python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

2) Activate virtual environment (windows)

venvname/Scripts/Activate

3) cd folder/with/the/project

python manage.py runserver

DONE.

pd: if u dont have the libraries needed, you might use:

pip install library-name

For example:

pip install Django
